# FEND-Project-01

This is my first project in the FEND program.

The task was to create a simple portfolio website using responsive layout and responsive images.

I've used flexbox to complete this project and the CSS is following the BEM (Block-element-modifier) naming methodology.

I've also used "srcset" for including high resolution retina display images for different devices.
